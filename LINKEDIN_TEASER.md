# üöÄ Building the Ultimate Medical OCR Pipeline: 13 State-of-the-Art Engines in One Platform

Just wrapped up an incredible AI engineering challenge - integrating 13 cutting-edge OCR engines into a unified medical document processing pipeline! 

## What we built:
‚úÖ **Latest AI Models**: DeepSeek-OCR (3B), Qwen3-VL (32B), olmOCR-2.7B, dots.ocr  
‚úÖ **Traditional + Modern**: From Tesseract to PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B  
‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Docker containers, health monitoring, parallel processing  
‚úÖ **Medical Focus**: Prescription parsing, radiology reports, clinical notes  

## The challenge:
Transforming complex medical documents (handwritten prescriptions, scan artifacts, multi-language text) into structured, AI-ready data that doctors and healthcare systems can actually use.

## Key insight:
No single OCR engine is perfect for medical documents. Each has strengths - DeepSeek excels at context compression, PaddleOCR handles 109 languages, dots.ocr delivers surgical precision. The magic happens when they work together.

Coming soon: A detailed breakdown of lessons learned building enterprise-grade AI infrastructure, model selection strategies, and why healthcare AI demands this level of redundancy.

What's your experience with multi-model AI systems? Ever had to choose between 13 different solutions?
